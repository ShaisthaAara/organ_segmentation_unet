# organ_segmentation_unet

This repository contains the implementation of a U-Net architecture for multi-organ segmentation in medical images. U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture known for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks.

Multi-Organ Segmentation: The model is trained to segment multiple organs simultaneously from medical images, providing precise delineation.

U-Net Architecture: Utilizes the U-Net architecture, which is renowned for its ability to capture fine details while maintaining contextual information.

Check out the given .ipynb file for the code.
